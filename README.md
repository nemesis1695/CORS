## Results

This code is a simple and effective tool called "CORS Scanner" designed to check and identify vulnerabilities related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies on websites. When a website lacks appropriate CORS policies, it can lead to attacks such as cross-origin camera spoofing, theft of user data, and other security threats. This tool can help to identify and address CORS vulnerabilities.

Using this tool, you can input the URL of the website you want to examine and check its CORS policies. The tool sends an OPTIONS request to the specified website and then analyzes the response to provide comprehensive information, including CORS headers and any associated vulnerabilities.
